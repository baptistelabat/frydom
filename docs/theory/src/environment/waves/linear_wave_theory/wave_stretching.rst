Kinematic stretching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The linear wave theory is based on the linearization of the free surface condition on the mean water level :math:`z=0`.
In case of irregular wave profile, the superposition of regular wave components can lead to unrealistic velocity estimation particularly in the crest. Stretching method are applied on the scaling factor :math:`E(z)` to overcome this issue.

.. math::
    E(z) = \frac{\cosh(k(z+H))}{\sinh(kH)}

The different methods are presented in the following.

Vertical stretching:
--------------------

The vertical stretching method assumes that the scaling factor above the mean water level is constant and equals to
its value at the mean water level :math:`E(0)`.

.. math::
	E(z) = \Biggl \lbrace {
        E(0) \text{ if } z \geq 0
        \atop
        E(z) \text{ otherwise}
    }

This method results in an abrupt, non-physical, :math:`E(z)` evolution when crossing the mean water level.

Extrapolation stretching:
-------------------------

To correct this non-physical evolution, the extrapolation stretching method introduces a correction to the vertical method.

.. math::
	E(z) = \Biggl \lbrace {Â 
	    E(0) + z \frac{\partial E}{\partial z}(0) \text{ if } z \geq 0
        \atop
        E(z) \text{ otherwise}
    }

Wheeler stretching:
-------------------

This method stretches the vertical scale factor, in order to obtain at :math:`z=\eta`, the kinematic given by the linear theory
at :math:`z=0`. The corresponding transformation changes :math:`z` into :math:`z'` :

.. math::
    z' = H \frac{z-\eta}{H+\eta}

where :math:`H` is the water depth and :math:`\eta` is the instantaneous wave elevation given by the linear wave model.

The wheeler stretching is defined for : :math:`H < z < \eta`


Chakrabarti stretching:
-----------------------

In this method, proposed by Chakrabarti [Chakrabarti1971]_, the water depth :math:`h` in the denominator is corrected by the wave elevation :math:`\eta` :

.. math::
	E(z) = \frac{\cosh(k(z+h))}{\sinh(k(h+\eta))}

Delta-stretching:
-----------------

This method is a coupling between the Wheeler and the extrapolation stretching, proposed by Rodenbush and Forristall [Rodenbush1986]_.
While :math:`E(z)` is still replaced by :math:`E(z')`, the transformation :math:`z \longrightarrow z'` becomes

- for :math:`z > -H_{\Delta}` : :math:`z' = (z + H_{\Delta}) \frac{H_{\Delta} + \Delta.eta}{H_{\Delta} + \eta} - H_{\Delta}`
- for :math:`z < -H_{\Delta}` : :math:`z' = z`

:math:`\Delta` is a parameter taken between 0 and 1, and :math:`H_{\Delta}` is the water height on which the stretching is applied.

The Delta-stretching method can be downgraded to one of the two methods, in using specific values for :math:`H_{\Delta}`
and :math:`\Delta`:

- for :math:`H_{\Delta} = H` and :math:`\Delta = 0`, the method is equivalent to the Wheeler stretching.
- for :math:`H_{\Delta} = H` and :math:`\Delta = 1`, it is equivalent to the extrapolation stretching.

Rodenbush and Forristall recommend using :math:`\Delta = 0.3` and :math:`H_{\Delta} = H_S/2`. However Molin [Molin2002]_ suggests that
:math:`H_{\Delta} = H`, the water depth, is usually chosen.
