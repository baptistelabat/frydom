ITTC78 resistance force
-----------------------


The total resistance force of a ship without bilge keels, defined by the ITTC78 procedures [ITTC78]_, is

.. math::
    F = -\frac{1}{2} \rho S C_t V^2

where

- :math:`S` is the ship wetted area,
- :math:`V` is the ship velocity
- :math:`C_t` is the total resistance coefficient associated

This coefficient is given by
.. math::
    C_t = (1+k)C_f + C_r + C_a + C_{aa} + C{app}

where

- :math:`1+k` is the hull form coefficient,
- :math:`C_f` is the calculated frictional coefficient,
- :math:`C_r` is the residual coefficient,
- :math:`C_a` is the roughness allowance coefficient,
- :math:`C_{aa}` is the air resistance coefficient,
- :math:`C_{app}` is the appendage resistance coefficient,

The calculated frictional coefficient is given by

.. math::
    C_f = \frac{0.075}{(\log_{10}(Re) - 2)^2}

where :math:`Re = V L_{PP}/\nu` is the Reynolds number.

Except :math:`C_f`, all other coefficients must be given by the user. They are generally obtained through CFD calculations
or experiments. The residual coefficient can be obtained, for example, from model tests:

.. math::
    C_r = C_{tm} - (1+k)C_{fm}

where :math:`C_{tm}` and :math:`C_{fm}` are the total measured resistance coefficient and calculated model frictional
coefficient.

The form factor :math:`1+k` is usually determined from the resistance tests at low speed range or by Prohaskaâ€™s plot
of :math:`C_{fm}` against :math:`F_n^4`:

.. math::
    \frac{C_t}{C_f} = (1+k) + y \frac{F_n^4}{C_f}

where

- :math:`1+k` is the intercept on the :math:`C_t/C_f` axis,
- :math:`y` is the slope coefficient,
