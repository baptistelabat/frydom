Environment theory
******************

The environment model contains all information about the surrounding of the study.

Flow field model (wind and current)
===================================

In construction

Uniform flow field
------------------

Wind and current flow models are based on a uniform flow field : the flow velocity is constant anywhere in the domain.


Fluid physical properties (air and seawater)
============================================

In construction

The fluid physical properties modeled in FRyDoM are

- :math:`T` : temperature, in degree Celsius
- :math:`\rho` : density, in (kg/m³)
- :math:`\mu` : dynamic viscosity, in (Pa.s)
- :math:`\nu` : kinematic viscosity, in (m²/s)
- :math:`S_A` : salinity, in (g/kg)
- :math:`p` : pressure, in (MPa)

It is possible to get the seawater physical properties, for different temperatures and salinity, in the ITTC
recommended procedures [ITTC]_.
