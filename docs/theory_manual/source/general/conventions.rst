Frame conventions
=================

Two frame conventions are defined:

- North-West-Up (NWU) : used in seakeeping theory, the X-Y-Z axes are respectively North, West and Up directions.
- North-East-Down (NED) : used in manoeuvring theory, the X-Y-Z axes are respectively North, East and Down directions.

The frame convention has to be specified for all methods setting positions, velocities, directions of bodies, flows, etc.

Direction conventions
=====================

Two direction conventions are defined: GOTO and COMEFROM. A GOTO North direction is opposed to a COMEFROM North direction.

The direction convention is required for setting velocity flow, ship heading, wave direction, etc.
