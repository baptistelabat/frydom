Setting the Environment parameters (demo_Environment.cpp) {#tutorial_demo_Environment}
==========================

Introduction to the Environment components. Learn how to set:
- the atmosphere parameters, composed of the air physical properties and the wind field model
- the ocean parameters, composed of the sea water physical properties, current field model and free surface.
- the GeographicServices, which gives access to conversion between cartesian and geographic coordinates
- the time ramp function, which is by default applied on the current, wind and wave field models
