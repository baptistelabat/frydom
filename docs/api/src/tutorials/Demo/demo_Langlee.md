Demonstration of a Langlee decay test (demo_Langlee.cpp) {#tutorial_demo_Langlee}
=============================================================

This demo features the Langlee wave energy converter system with a flap decay test. This system
is composed of two flaps free to move in pitch motion. The first flap has an initial angle equal to 10 degrees
and the second one is at its equilibrium position. At t=0s the first flap is free to
return to its equilibrium position and oscillate around the this position.
