Benchmark for a decay test on a sphere (bench_SphereDecay.cpp) {#tutorial_bench_sphere_decay}
==================================================================

This benchmark corresponds to the simulation of a sphere in free-decay test. This simulation is presented by the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) Offshore Energy System (OES) Task 10 [OES10] as a benchmark case for model validation 
and verification regrouping 25 organizations.
