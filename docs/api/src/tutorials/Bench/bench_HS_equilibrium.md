Benchmark on hydrostatic equilibrium solver (bench_HS_equilibrium.cpp) {#tutorial_bench_HS_equilibrium}
================================================

This bench aims at solving the hydrostatic equilibrium of three different body geometries subject to several loadings.
Their results are compared with Meshmagick ones, in terms of geometric and hydrostatic quantities (draught, stiffness matrix, etc.)
