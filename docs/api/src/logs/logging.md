Output/Logging {#logging}
==============

Logs outputs are .csv file format, with a two lines header (name and unit of the variables). Each object class generate its own log file. Logs are organised into folders according to the [tree architecture](#tree-architecture), ie the logs of the forces and nodes are stored into body folders and the body's, link's, cables's log are stored in the system folder. Logging output for the [test DTMB5512](#tutorial_bench_DTMB) and a part of the [hexagonal articulated buoy demo](#tutorial_demo_HexagonalArticulatedBuoy) are represented in next figures.

![Figure : Representation of the logs output architecture](TreeLog_Merge_w300.png "TreeLog_DTMB5512") 

The logging output are written in a folder with the date and time of the simulation. This folder is created in the data folder defined in the [.frydom_config](#config-file). 

Definition of the different files are the following.


Event file
----------

The *events* file contains all the execution log information of the simulation. An example of the begining of this file is given in the next figure.

The first three lines corresponds to general information for the execution logging.

The next lines contain the following information:

    [time] [level] [type] [name] message
    
where :

- *time* is the current time of the simulation from the beggining,
- *level* is the level of information, ie info/warning/error,
- *type* is the type of the object concerned by the message,
- *name* is the name of the object concerned by the message,
- *message* is the message generated by the code.

**Note** : The convention NED/NWU used for the vector is defined in the .frydom_config file.


Config file 
-----------

A .frydom_config file, in JSON, to be placed in home folder, is used to specify the location of the logs root folder. The frame convention to be used in the logs (NED or NWU) is also defined in this config file. If no config file is provided, the logs are in NED and located in the execution folder.

    {
        "frydom_config": {            
            "log_folder": "/path/to/logs/",
            "frame_convention": "NED"
        }    
    }


Adding logs to an object
------------------------

To add logs to new classes, you need to implement the following steps:

- derive from FrLoggable<ParentType>


    class FrDummy : public FrLoggable<ParentType> {}
    
    
- activate the logs either at the class scope or the instance scope, using the method 


    FrLoggable<>::LogThis(true);
    
    
- define the log message by overriding the method *FrLoggable<>::DefineLogMessage()* in the new class. In this method you need to create a new message with a name and description and add field variables as the following example:


    auto msg = NewMessage("Name", "Description");
    
    msg->AddField<double>("time", "s", "Current time of the simulation", [this]() { return GetSystem()->GetTime(); })
    
    msg->AddField<Eigen::Matrix<double, 3, 1>>("Position", "m", fmt::format("body position in the world reference frame in {}", GetLogFC()), [this]() {Â return GetPosition(GetLogFC()); });
