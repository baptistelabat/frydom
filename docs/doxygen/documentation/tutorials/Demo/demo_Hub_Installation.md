Demonstration of the installation of a hub by a floating barge (demo_Hub_Installation.cpp) {#tutorial_demo_Hub_Installation}
=========================================================================

This demo features the manipulation of a payload by a crane on a floating barge, in a 1m height regular wave field. 
Almost all features of FRyDoM are included in this demo : floating body with hydrodynamic load, kinematic links between 
bodies, mooring lines, etc. A static analysis can be performed before the dynamic simulation, in order to start with the
complex system at rest, before the incoming of the wave.
