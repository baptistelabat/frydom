Demonstration case with the FOSWEC model (demo_FOSWEC.cpp) {#tutorial_demo_FOSWEC}
============================================================

This demo features the Floating Oscillating Surge Wave Energy Converter (FOSWEC) Phase 2, tested by the
Sandia National Laboratory for hydrodynamic model validation. The geometry is specifically design to provide
a comprehensive validation dataset for hydrodynamic interaction. The model is composed with
two lateral floating buoys and two flaps free to move in pitch motion.

Different configurations are tested on this demo :

- flap decay test
- regular wave load on fixe structure
- flap pitch motion with regular wave conditions
