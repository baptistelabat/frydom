Demonstration of a ballistic application, with contacts between bodies (demo_Ballistic.cpp) {#tutorial_demo_Ballistic}
==========================

This demo presents basic features of FRyDoM, with EasyBody (box and spheres). The makeIt* functions set-up the collision
box, corresponding asset and inertia tensor. We simulate the free fall of several balls with an initial velocity on a 
floor, with collisions between the balls.
