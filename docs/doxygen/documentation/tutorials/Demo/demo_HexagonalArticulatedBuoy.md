Demonstration of a complex articulated floating system with regular waves (demo_HexagonalArticulatedBuoy.cpp) {#tutorial_demo_HexagonalArticulatedBuoy}
=============================================================================================

This demo features the behaviour of a hexagonal floating system, composed of six cylindrical buoys interconnected by spherical joins,
 submitted to a regular wave of 0.1 m height and 3 s of wave period.
