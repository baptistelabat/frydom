Benchmark for a sphere in irregular waves (bench_SphereIrregular.cpp.cpp.cpp) {#tutorial_bench_sphere_irregular}
=======================================

This comparison corresponds to the simulation of a sphere in heave motion submitted to irregular waves. The model is 
presented by the International Energy Agency (IEA) Offshore Energy System (OES) Task 10 [OES10] as a benchmark case for 
model validation and verification regrouping 25 organizations.
