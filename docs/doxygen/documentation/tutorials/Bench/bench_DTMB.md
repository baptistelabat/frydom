Benchmark for a DTMB5512 (bench_DTMB5512.cpp) {#tutorial_bench_DTMB}
=================================================

This benchmark corresponds to the simulation of the surface combatant DTMB5512 with constant forward speed submitted to regular head waves.
The DTMB5512 is a 3.048m geosym of the DTMB5415 which have been chosen by the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) as an international benchmark for CFD validation.
Two configurations are considered, captive motion and free motion in pitch and heave.
