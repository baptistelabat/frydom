Benchmark for a DTMB (bench_DTMB5512_captive.cpp) {#tutorial_bench_DTMB}
==========================

This benchmark corresponds to the simulation of the surface combatant DTMB5512 in captive motion submitted to regular 
head wave. The DTMB5512 is a 3.048m geosym of the DTMB5415 which have been chosen by the International Towing Tank 
Conference (ITTC) as an international benchmark for CFD validation.
