FRyDoM's Tools Directory
========================


This directory is intended to group FRyDoM's utilities that are used for pre or post processing of data and simulations.

Files that are at the root of this directory should be command line utilities and then be executable. For ease of use
this folder should be added to the PATH of the system for these utilities to be accessible as command line tools everywhere
at the system level.

Folders placed in the current Tool folder should be resources such as Python packages and are intended to be used by the
command line tools.
