FRyDoM-ce: Flexible and Rigid body Dynamics modeling for Marine operations  (Community Edition)
===============================================================================================

FRyDoM-ce is an open source framework for the simulation of complex systems involved in marine 
operations for Marine Renewables.
FRyDoM is a physics-based modeling and simulation framework dedicated to complex marine platforms,
structures, systems and operations. Built on a powerful multipurpose multibody dynamics numerical 
core, its object oriented modular architecture is designed to be embedded in a large range of 
application; from embedded systems up to Virtual Reality Solutions.

Implemented in modern C++, FRyDoM is released under open source GPLv3 (see LICENCE file) in 
order to provide a high-end framework to the marine community.

FRyDoM-ce (community edition) is the property of Ecole Centrale de Nantes and is maintained by 
DICE-Engineering company. D-ICE Engineering is currently developing training sessions programs 
that will help you to master FRyDoM framework. 
Please contact <a href=mailto:frydom-training@dice-engineering.com>FRyDoM training</a> for more details.

This work was carried out within the framework of the WEAMEC, West Atlantic Marine Energy Community, 
and with funding from the Pays de la Loire Region.
